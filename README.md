# MultiEigenMerge
The original program for merging genotype files in eigenstrat format, i.e., "mergeit" enclosed in EIGENSOFT (https://github.com/DReichLab/EIG) and ADMIXTOOLS (https://github.com/DReichLab/AdmixTools) packages, can only merge two file every time. 
Accounting that, I wrote this R code ("MultiEigenMerge.R") to generate parameter files and the bash file for merging multiple (>2) genotype files in eigenstrat format.
